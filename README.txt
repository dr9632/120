SIDE NOTES ==================================================
The tutorial will only play once in the beginning if its the first time running the game (uses local storage).
If the difficulty is too hard, you can go to settings and set it to easier mode.
AND if noob mode is still too difficult, you can push P and it will reset your poo bar to half. Or press G O D simultaneously when on menu screen to activate cheat mode.

Thank you for playing
