The tutorial will only play once in the beginning if its the first time running the game (local storage).
If the difficulty is too hard, you can go to settings  and there are different difficulty settings.
AND if noob mode is still too difficult, you can push P and it will reset your poo bar to half. Or press G O D simultaneously when on menu screen to activate cheat mode.

Thank you for playing and grading
